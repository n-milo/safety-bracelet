# Safety Bracelet

This repository holds the code for the Safety Bracelet, designed for
APSC 200. The user presses a button on the bracelet, and the app will
contact one of the user's emergency contacts. An Arduino listens for
button presses, and transmits data to a Bluetooth client running the
receiver app. The receiver app will then text an emergency contact.
